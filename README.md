ODLpp
=====

C++ backend for ODL

Introduction
--------------------
This is a default backend for ODL, intended to contain examples of ODL interactions with C++.

It contains a default implementation of a CUDA based Rn space with associated methods.

Building
--------------------
The project uses CMake to enable builds. Using *cmake-gui* is recommended

[Cmake webpage](http://www.cmake.org/)

#### Unix:
Start by going the the directory where you want your binaries and run,

    cmake-gui PATH_TO_SOURCE

Set the required variables.

To build and install the package to your python installation, run (as root)

    make pyinstall

To verify your installation, run (in the odlpp directory)

    py.test

This requires the [pytest](http://pytest.org/latest/) package.

#### Windows

To build on windows, open the CMake gui, run configure-generate and set the required variables. Then open the project with Visual Studio and build `pyinstall`.

Code guidelines
--------------------
The code is written in C++11/14.

### Compilers
The code is intended to be usable with all major compilers. Current status (2015-06-22) is

| Platform     	| Compiler 	| Cuda 	| Compute 	| Works 	|
|--------------	|----------	|------	|---------	|-------	|
| Windows 7    	| VS2013   	| 7.0  	| 2.0     	| ✔     	|
| Windows 7    	| VS2013   	| 7.0  	| 5.2     	| ✔     	|
| Windows 10   	| VS2015   	| 7.0  	| 5.2     	| TODO  	|
| Fedora 21    	| GCC 4.9  	| 7.0  	| 5.2     	| ✔     	|
| Ubuntu ?.? 	| ???      	| 7.0  	| 5.2     	| ✔     	|
| Mac OSX 	| ???      	| 7.0  	| 5.2     	| TODO     	|

### Formating
The code is formatted using [CLang format](http://clang.llvm.org/docs/ClangFormat.html) as provided by the LLVM project. The particular style used is defined in the [formatting file](_clang-format).

External Dependences
--------------------
Current external dependencies are

#####Python
The building block of ODL, ODLpp needs access to both python and numpy header files and compiled files to link against.

[Python webpage](https://www.python.org/)

#####Numpy
Backend used for easy interfacing of numerical data.

[Numpy webpage](http://www.numpy.org/)

#####CUDA
Used for GPU accelerated versions of algorithms. The code uses C++11 features in device code, so CUDA 7.0 is required. CUDA 6.5 may work on some platforms (notably windows). It should as of now compile with compute capbability >2.0, in the future certain features require higher compute capability may be added.

### Included
These are distributed with this project.

#####PyBind11
Library for creating python bindings for c++ code.

Troublefinding
--------------
There are a few common errors encountered, this is the solution to some of these

## Installation
* When compiling if, you get a error like

        NumpyConfig.h not found

    then it is likely that the variable `PYTHON_NUMPY_INCLUDE_DIR` is not correctly set.

* Compiling

        error C1083: Cannot open include file: 'Eigen/Core': No such file or directory.

    you have tried to build the default target, instead build target "pyinstall".


* Compiling

        [ 20%] Building NVCC (Device) object ODLpp/CMakeFiles/cuda.dir//./cuda_generated_cuda.cu.o /usr/include/c++/4.9.2/bits/alloc_traits.h(248): error: expected a ">"

    It may be that you are trying to compile with CUDA 6.5 and GCC 4.9, this combination is not supported by CUDA.

* Compiling

        error LNK1112: module machine type 'x64' conflicts with target machine type 'X86'

    You have a 64-bit library on your path (Boost for instance) while trying to build 32-bit odlpp. Either change the lib, or configure to build 64-bit. On Windows, if you are using Visual Studio to compile use Configuration Manager to set platform to x64, if you are compiling on command line via CMake ensure that the Script Generator is for instance "Visual Studio 12 2013 Win64" (note the Win64 at the end).


* If you get a error like

        Error	5	error LNK2019: unresolved external symbol "__declspec(dllimport) struct _object * __cdecl boost::python::detail::init_module(struct PyModuleDef &,void (__cdecl*)(void))" (__imp_?init_module@detail@python@boost@@YAPEAU_object@@AEAUPyModuleDef@@P6AXXZ@Z) referenced in function PyInit_utils	C:\Programming\Projects\ODLpp_bin\RLcpp\utils.obj	utils

    then it is likely that you are trying to build against unmatched python header files and boost python version

## Running

* If, when running the tests in python, you get an error like

        RuntimeError: function_attributes(): after cudaFuncGetAttributes: invalid device function

    It may be that the compute version used is not supported by your setup, try changing the cmake variable `CUDA_COMPUTE`.

* If, when running the test in python, you encounter an error like

        ImportError: No module named odlpp

    It may be that you have not installed the package, run (as root) `make pyinstall` or equivalent.
